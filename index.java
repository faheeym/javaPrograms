/*
(Science: day of the week) Zellerâ€™s congruence is an algorithm developed by Christian Zeller to calculate the day of the week. The formula is

h=(q+(26(m+1)))+k+(k/4)+(j/4)+(5*j))%7

where
h is the day of the week (0: Saturday, 1: Sunday, 2: Monday, 3: Tuesday, 4: Wednesday, 5: Thursday, and 6: Friday).
q is the day of the month.
m is the month (3: March, 4: April, ..., 12: December). January and February are counted as months 13 and 14 of the previous year.
j is year/100.
k is the year of the century (i.e., year % 100).

Note all divisions in this exercise perform an integer division.

(Hint: January and February are counted as 13 and 14 in the formula, so you need to convert the user input 1 to 13 and 2 to 14 for the month and change the year to the previous year. For example, if the user enters 1 for m and 2015 for year, m will be 13 and year will be 2014 used in the formula.)

Write a program that prompts the user to enter a year, month, and day of the month, and displays the name of the day of the week.

Here is a sample run:

Enter year: (e.g., 2008): 2019
Enter month: 1-12: 1
Enter the day of the month: 1-31: 22
Day of the week is Tuesday
