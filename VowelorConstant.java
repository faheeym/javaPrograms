(Vowel or Consonant) Write a program that will ask the user to enter a letter and check whether the letter is a vowel or a consonant. If the user enters something that is not a letter, display that it is an invalid input. Here are a few sample runs:
Enter a letter: A
A is a vowel

Enter a letter: b
b is a consonant

Enter a letter: ?
? is an invalid input
